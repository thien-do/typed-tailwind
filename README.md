# Typed Tailwind · [typed-tailwind.com](https://typed-tailwind.com)

Typed Tailwind brings types to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) by generating TypeScript classes ([example](https://github.com/dvkndn/typed-tailwind/blob/master/src/style/index.ts)) whose methods let you use the utility classes generated from your Tailwind config:

## Why

I wanted to combine the 2 great things in Front End engineering nowadays: [static typing](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [functional CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first). Turn out, they get along very well. The constraint and predictability of utilities classes makes them ideal candidates to be statically typed as methods of a TypeScript class.

**Is it more than just [code completion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)?** Yes. Code completion is just suggestion. Static typing _enforces_ the correctness of your ~~code~~ styling, so you can do things like defining better API, automated code refactoring, and errors (like using undefined colors) can be caught at compile time.

## Usage

1. Go to [typed-tailwind.com](https://typed-tailwind.com) and paste your Tailwind [configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) into the first panel.
2. Save the generated file in the second panel to your codebase.
3. Import the `Tw` function from that file and use its ([chain-able](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining)) methods:

```tsx
// In practice, the file should be imported using absolute path
import { Tw } from "./tw";

const Foo = () => (
  <p className={Tw().textBlue().fontBold().$()}>
    Bold, blue text
  </p>
);
```

### Where to put the generated file?

The file should be imported from many places in your codebase so place it where you can take advantage of absolute imports. For example, if you are using CRA and your [`baseUrl`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/importing-a-component#absolute-imports) is the `src` folder then you can place the file at `src/tw/index.ts`.

```ts
import { Tw } from "tw";
```

### Does it work without TypeScript?

Yes. You can always compile the generated file to JS, optionally with a [declaration file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html):

```sh
tsc --declaration style.ts
```

This way, you still get full [code completion](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), just no compile time type checking.

### Does it work with PurgeCSS?

Not yet. It requires either a custom extractor or a webpack loader to transform to normal string at compile time. Both are [planned](https://github.com/dvkndn/typed-tailwind/issues/2). In the meantime, try [remove unused values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size#removing-unused-theme-values).

### Does it work with custom plugins?

It's not officially supported yet but could work if your plugins are defined as inline anonymous functions (like in the [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins)). Also see: [Does it work with custom classes](#oes-it-work-with-custom-classes).

### Does it work with custom classes?

Yes. The result is simply a source file, so feel free to modify it anyway you want:

```typescript
// style.ts

class Tailwind {
  /* ... */
  
  // Add your custom ones:
  textShadow(): Tailwind { return this.add("text-shadow"); }
}
```

### Is there any performance issue?

Out of the box, it's a run time solution so it's slower and use more memory than typing the class strings directly. However, this can be improved:

- Move the calls out of the renders. The work is still done at run time, but just once at start-up instead of every render.

    ```tsx
    const styles = Tw().fontBold().textBlue().$();
    
    const Foo = () => <p className={styles} />;
    ```
- Use a build plugin to handle all the works at compile time. It does not exist yet but is [planned](https://github.com/dvkndn/typed-tailwind/issues/1).

### The generated code style doesn't match ours. Can I reformat it?

Yes. The generated code should be checked into your source control so you can (and should) format it with your code formatter. In other words, just judge it as your own source code.

### Is there a CLI?

It's [planned](https://github.com/dvkndn/typed-tailwind/issues/3).
